# HAL

This bot was originally adapted from [HAL](https://github.com/danryan/hal) which is no longer maintained. This project should be regarded as a WIP. HAL _was_ a multipurpose chatbot framework, however, it will be Slack only as we move forward.

# Development instructions

1. `make all`
2. Insert your slack token into `run.sh`
3. `chmod a+x run.sh`
4. `./run.sh`
